#Fall 2012 End of Semester

Gustavo and Scott went to PCSI to do a data collection.

We put the BeagleBone inside the central cap where the blades come together.

We attached the sensors similarly to how the accelerometers were attached
to the original turbine.

We collected 10,000 samples per sensor with the wind tunnel running.

The data is below:

![FFT](https://github.com/scottcarr/beagle/blob/master/fft.png?raw=true)

In order to validate the data, the next step will be to put out accelerometer
on the same blade as the original accelerometers and compare the two.
