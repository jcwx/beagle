#Fall 2012 End of Semester

Gustavo and Scott went to PCSI to do a data collection.

We put the BeagleBone inside the central cap where the blades come together.

We attached the sensors similarly to how the accelerameters were attached
to the original turbine.

We collected 10,000 samples per sensor with the wind tunnel running.
